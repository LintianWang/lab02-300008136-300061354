| Design 2: Store polar coordinates only | Computed on demand, but not stored| Simply returned |
| Design 3: Store cartesian coordinates only | Simply returned | Computed on demand, but not stored |
| Design 6: Interface with designs 2 and 3 as classes implementing it. | Depends on the concrete class used | Depends on the concrete class used |
