# How we did the tests
First, we choosed type P in design 2 and also entered the point, then run the code in design 2. Then, we changed the type to C 
to see the result. Second, we choosed type C in design 3 and also entered the point, then run the code. Then, we changed the 
type to P to see the result. In design 6, we put C and the point into the code with two results, and the same with type P.
# Sample outputs from running the tests

if the type is Polar, result as follow:
Cartesian-Polar Coordinates Conversion Program
Enter the type of Coordinates you are inputting ((C)artesian / (P)olar): p
Enter the value of Rho using a decimal point(.): 2.4
Enter the value of Theta using a decimal point(.): 5.6

You entered:
Stored as Polar (2.4,5.6)
Computed Cartesian as (2.388545759956395,0.2341989594219587)

If the type is Cartesian, result as follow:
Cartesian-Polar Coordinates Conversion Program
Enter the type of Coordinates you are inputting ((C)artesian / (P)olar): c
Enter the value of X using a decimal point(.): 1.4
Enter the value of Y using a decimal point(.): 5.8

You entered:
Stored as Polar (5.966573556070519,76.42956561483852)
