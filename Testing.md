# How we did the tests
First, we choosed type P in design 2 and also entered the point, then run the code in design 2. Then, we changed the type to C 
to see the result. Second, we choosed type C in design 3 and also entered the point, then run the code. Then, we changed the 
type to P to see the result. In design 6, we put C and the point into the code with two results, and the same with type P.
