| Design | Avantages | Disavantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design 2: Store polar coordinates only | coordinates of Polar, simply returned, fast| coordinates of Cartesian, computed on demand, but not stored, illegalArgumentException |
| Design 3: Store cartesian coordinates only | coordinates of Cartesian, simply returned, fast | coordinates of Polar, computed on demand, but not stored,illegalArgumentException |
| Design 6: Interface with designs 2 and 3 as classes implementing it. | Depends on the concrete class used | Depends on the concrete class used |
